    "Functional programming in Python often goes hand in hand with lazy evaluation. Tools like map and filter do not process data immediately; instead, they create lazy iterators that generate values only when needed. This allows data to flow through a chain of transformations efficiently, without creating unnecessary intermediate results.\n",

    "| **Lazy Evaluation** | An evaluation strategy where values are only computed when they are needed, also known as *call-by-need*. |\n",
    "| **Iterable** | A Python object that can be looped over (iterated). Examples include lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, strings, etc. |\n",
    "| **Iterator** | An object that can be iterated upon and produces a sequence of values one at a time. Iterators maintain state and are exhausted after one pass. |\n",
    "| **Iterator Protocol** | A set of rules requiring an object to implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to be considered an iterator in Python. |\n",
    "| **`iter()`** | A built-in function that returns an iterator from an iterable object. |\n",
    "| **`next()`** | A built-in function that returns the next item from an iterator, raising `StopIteration` when no items remain. |\n",
    "| **Generator** | A special type of function that uses `yield` instead of `return` and produces an iterator object that generates values lazily. |\n",
    "| **`yield`** | A Python keyword used inside functions to produce a generator; it yields values one at a time instead of returning a single result. |\n"
