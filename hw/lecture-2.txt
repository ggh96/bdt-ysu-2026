Beginner level tasks

1. Multiprocessing
    a. get to know yfinance (pandas_datareader) python library to download stock prices for given dates
    b. download/save stock prices of sp500 for 1y/5y using single process vs multiprocessing
    c. compare and visualize results

2 Functional programming
    a. utilize map, filter, funtool.reduce (a1. show your effort with no resources, a2. show your research using other tools)
        - define ls = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] in python
        - square all numbers
        - keep only primes
        - compute sum of squares
        - compute MSE
    b. use lambda functions with pd.DataFrame.apply() to mutate a column/columns (show what you learned)

ONLY submit jupyter notebook in github from your repo dedicated to this course only.
Keep your notebook structured with related comments and text snippets.
DO NOT push any redundant code, keep code readability.
